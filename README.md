Simple chrome extension can switch between "work" and "play" mode. On work mode, it blocks some time-wasting sites based on hostnames and
keywords in the content. Default mode is "work", and a user has to confirm before switching to 'play' mode, where user can browse freely.
There's a time limit for 'play' mode, after that the extension will switch to 'work' again.
